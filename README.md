# <h1> Wrangling and Visualizing Musical Data 

<h3> This project utilized basic R  functions and libraries including Dplyr, ggplot2, and readr to manipulate and visualize musical data. We used bigrams and other functions to give us a better understanding to the chord frequency and chord prorgression frequency.
 
# <h3> I was motivated to do this project to further enhance my data visualization and wrangling skills in R. I learned more about dplyr and readr as well as data cleaning and visualization.

<h5> *I got the project idea from https://projects.datacamp.com/projects/78 and utilized the steps and inspirtation in the project from that website.*
