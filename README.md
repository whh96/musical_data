# <h1> Visualizing Musical Data 

<h3> This project utilizes basic R  functions and libraries including Dplyr, ggplot2, and readr to manipulate and visualize musical data. I used bigrams and other functions to give a better understanding to the chord frequency and chord progression frequency.
 
# <h3> I was motivated to do this project to further enhance my data visualization and manipulation skills in R. I learned more about dplyr and readr as well as data cleaning and visualization.

<h5> *I got the project idea from https://projects.datacamp.com/projects/78 and utilized the steps and inspiration in the project from that website.*
